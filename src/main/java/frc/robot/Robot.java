 * ROBOT.JAVA - THE ENTRY POINT FOR YOUR FRC ROBOT
 * ========================================================================
 *
 * START HERE! This is where everything begins when your robot powers on.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * --------------------
 * This file is the "main" of your robot code. It controls the overall
 * program flow and tells the robot what to do during each phase of a match:
 *
 *   DISABLED   ->  AUTONOMOUS  ->  TELEOP  ->  DISABLED
 *   (waiting)     (15 sec)       (2:15)     (match over)
 *
 * HOW FRC ROBOT CODE WORKS:
 * -------------------------
 * Unlike a normal program that runs once and exits, robot code runs in
 * LOOPS. The robot constantly cycles through your code, running specific
 * methods over and over.
 *
 *   +-------------------------------------------------------------+
 *   |                    THE 20ms LOOP                            |
 *   |                                                             |
 *   |   Every 20 milliseconds (50 times per second), the robot:   |
 *   |                                                             |
 *   |   1. Reads all sensors (gyro, encoders, cameras)            |
 *   |   2. Runs robotPeriodic()                                   |
 *   |   3. Runs the current mode's periodic (autonomousPeriodic,  |
 *   |      teleopPeriodic, etc.)                                  |
 *   |   4. Sends commands to motors                               |
 *   |   5. Repeats!                                               |
 *   |                                                             |
 *   +-------------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 * WHY TIMEDROBOT?
 * ---------------
 * TimedRobot is WPILib's base class that handles the timing for us.
 * It guarantees our code runs exactly every 20ms (configurable).
 * This is important because:
 *   - Physics calculations assume a fixed time step
 *   - PID controllers need consistent timing
 *   - Sensor readings need to be regular
 *
 * COMMAND-BASED PROGRAMMING:
 * --------------------------
 * We use "Command-Based" architecture, which means:
 *   - SUBSYSTEMS: Physical mechanisms (drivetrain, shooter, etc.)
 *   - COMMANDS: Actions that use subsystems (drive forward, shoot, etc.)
 *   - SCHEDULER: Decides which commands run when
 *
 * The CommandScheduler (called in robotPeriodic) is the "brain" that
 * manages all of this automatically. You just need to:
 *   1. Create subsystems in RobotContainer
 *   2. Write commands that use those subsystems
 *   3. Bind buttons to commands
 *
 * LIFECYCLE METHODS:
 * ------------------
 * Each robot mode has two methods:
 *   - xxxInit(): Called ONCE when entering that mode
 *   - xxxPeriodic(): Called repeatedly (every 20ms) while in that mode
 *
 *   Timeline during a match:
 *
 *   [Robot Powered On]
 *        |
 *        v
 *   robotInit() -------------------------------------------------------------
 *        |
 *        v
 *   disabledInit() -> disabledPeriodic() -> disabledPeriodic() -> ...
 *        |                                                     |
 *        | (Match starts - AUTO period)                        |
 *        v                                                     |
 *   autonomousInit() -> autonomousPeriodic() -> autonomousPeriodic() -> ...
 *        |                                                     |
 *        | (AUTO ends - TELEOP period)                         |
 *        v                                                     |
 *   teleopInit() -> teleopPeriodic() -> teleopPeriodic() -> ...   |
 *        |                                                     |
 *        | (Match ends)                                        |
 *        v                                                     |
 *   disabledInit() -> disabledPeriodic() ...                    |
 *                                                              |
 *   robotPeriodic() runs ALWAYS in ALL modes ------------------+
